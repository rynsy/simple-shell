User-Pluggin Shell, for CS 485: Systems Programming.

Should dynamically link 'pluggins' into a shell, and execute/reap children
properly.

TODO

Fix file redirection - Can't direct in and out at the same time
Fix job handling - Doesn't handle jobs correctly. Need to replace job struct with something that can be updated after a job has finished.
